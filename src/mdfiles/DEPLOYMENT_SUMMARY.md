# 🚀 Yoraa Backend Deployment Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Deployment Scripts Created**
- `deploy.sh` - Fully automated deployment script
- `server-setup.sh` - Server environment setup script
- Both scripts are executable and ready to use

### 2. **Configuration Files**
- `ecosystem.config.js` - PM2 process manager configuration
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- Health check endpoints added to main application

### 3. **Documentation**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `CONNECTION_GUIDE.md` - SSH troubleshooting guide
- Step-by-step instructions for manual deployment

### 4. **Application Enhancements**
- Added health check endpoints (`/` and `/health`)
- Production-ready configuration
- Proper error handling and logging setup

## ⚠️ Current Issue: SSH Connection

**Problem**: Cannot establish SSH connection to `185.199.219.244`
- Connection timeout on port 22
- Server might be behind firewall
- SSH might be on custom port
- Server might still be initializing

## 🎯 Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### 1. **Establish Server Access**
- Log into Contabo control panel
- Use VNC/Console access to connect to server
- Verify SSH service is running and configured
- Check firewall settings

### 2. **Upload Application**
Options:
- **Upload `yoraa-backend-deployment.tar.gz`** via web interface
- **Git clone** from your repository
- **SCP upload** once SSH is working

### 3. **Run Deployment**
Once you have server access:
```bash
# Extract files (if uploaded as archive)
tar -xzf yoraa-backend-deployment.tar.gz

# Run server setup
chmod +x server-setup.sh
./server-setup.sh

# Deploy application
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## 🌐 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- **API Base URL**: `http://185.199.219.244:8080`
- **Health Check**: `http://185.199.219.244:8080/health`
- **Status Check**: `http://185.199.219.244:8080`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Resources

1. **SSH Issues**: See `CONNECTION_GUIDE.md`
2. **Deployment Issues**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Server Configuration**: Use `server-setup.sh`

## 📞 Support Recommendations

1. **Check Contabo Panel**: Verify server status and settings
2. **Use VNC Access**: Bypass SSH issues with web console
3. **Contact Contabo**: For SSH port/firewall configuration
4. **Test Locally**: Verify application works with `npm start`
