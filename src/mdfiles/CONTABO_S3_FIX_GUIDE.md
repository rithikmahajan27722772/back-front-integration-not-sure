# ðŸ”§ Contabo S3 Public Access Configuration Guide

## Problem
Your uploaded images return "401 Unauthorized" when accessed publicly, even though:
- âœ… Bucket policy is set correctly
- âœ… Object ACLs are set to public-read
- âœ… Code is updated to use proper URL construction

## Root Cause
Contabo's S3 implementation requires **manual configuration** through their web dashboard to enable public access. Unlike AWS S3, Contabo doesn't honor programmatic ACL settings by default.

## ðŸš€ SOLUTION: Manual Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Access Contabo Dashboard
1. Go to [new.contabo.com](https://new.contabo.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Navigate to **Storage** â†’ **Object Storage**

### Step 2: Configure Bucket Public Access
1. Find your bucket: `yoraa-contabo-s3-bucket`
2. Click on the bucket name to open settings
3. Look for **Permissions**, **Access Control**, or **Public Access** section

### Step 3: Enable Public Read Access
Look for these options and enable them:
- âœ… **Allow public read access**
- âœ… **Enable public GET requests**
- âœ… **Allow anonymous access**
- âœ… **Public bucket** (if available)

### Step 4: Apply Bucket Policy (if needed)
If there's a bucket policy section, apply this policy:

\`\`\`json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yoraa-contabo-s3-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Save and Wait
- Save the changes
- Wait 2-5 minutes for propagation

## ðŸ§ª Test After Configuration

Run this command to test:
\`\`\`bash
curl -I "https://usc1.contabostorage.com/yoraa-contabo-s3-bucket/categories/68c08ac8c80590e20e90a15f/1757448904152_80AE446B-DD82-4CD6-81D2-2DF8B152EE82.jpeg"
\`\`\`

**Expected result:** `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Contact Contabo Support

If you can't find public access settings:
1. Contact Contabo support
2. Request to enable "public read access" for bucket: `yoraa-contabo-s3-bucket`
3. Mention you need S3-compatible public object access

## âœ… Code Updates Made

Your code has been updated with:
- âœ… Proper path-style URL construction
- âœ… Fallback ACL setting after upload
- âœ… Helper functions for consistent URL generation
- âœ… Enhanced logging for debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Configure bucket through Contabo dashboard** (most important)
2. Test the existing image URL after configuration
3. Upload a new image through your admin panel to test the complete flow

Once the bucket is configured correctly through the dashboard, all your uploaded images should be publicly accessible!
