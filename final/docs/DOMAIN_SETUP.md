# Setting up yoraa.in.net Custom Domain

## Your site is now deployed to Netlify!

**Current URLs:**
- Netlify URL: https://yoraa-final-admin.netlify.app
- Admin Dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/projects/yoraa-final-admin

## Steps to Configure Custom Domain (yoraa.in.net):

### 1. Add Custom Domain in Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/yoraa-final-admin
2. Navigate to "Domain management" in the sidebar
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter: `yoraa.in.net`
5. Click "Verify" and then "Add domain"

### 2. Configure DNS Records
After adding the domain in Netlify, you'll need to update your DNS records with your domain registrar:

**Option A: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended)**
- Change your nameservers to Netlify's nameservers (provided in dashboard)

**Option B: Keep existing DNS provider**
Add these records to your DNS provider:
- **CNAME record**: `www` pointing to `yoraa-final-admin.netlify.app`
- **A record**: `@` (root domain) pointing to Netlify's load balancer IP
- Or use **ALIAS/ANAME**: `@` pointing to `yoraa-final-admin.netlify.app`

### 3. Enable HTTPS
- Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- This usually takes a few minutes after DNS propagation

### 4. Set Primary Domain
- In Netlify dashboard > Domain management
- Set `yoraa.in.net` as your primary domain
- Enable "Force HTTPS redirect"

## DNS Propagation
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
- You can check propagation status using tools like:
  - https://dnschecker.org/
  - https://whatsmydns.net/

## Verification
Once DNS is configured, your site will be available at:
- https://yoraa.in.net
- https://www.yoraa.in.net (if configured)

## Troubleshooting
- If you see "Site not found", DNS may not be fully propagated
- If you see security warnings, SSL certificate may still be provisioning
- Check the Netlify dashboard for domain status and SSL certificate status
