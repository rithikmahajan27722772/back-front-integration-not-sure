# SSL Certificate Setup for yoraa.in.net

## Current Status
✅ **Site deployed successfully** to Netlify  
✅ **Domain configured** and pointing to Netlify  
✅ **HTTP access working** at http://yoraa.in.net  
⚠️ **SSL Certificate** needs to be provisioned  

## Issue Identified
The SSL certificate for yoraa.in.net is not yet provisioned. This is common when:
1. The domain was recently added to Netlify
2. DNS changes are still propagating
3. Let's Encrypt needs time to verify domain ownership

## Steps to Fix SSL Certificate Issue

### 1. Access Netlify Dashboard
Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/yoraa-final-admin/settings/domain

### 2. Check Domain Management
- Verify that `yoraa.in.net` is listed as a custom domain
- Check if there's a "Waiting for DNS propagation" or "Provisioning certificate" status
- If the domain shows any errors, remove and re-add it

### 3. Force SSL Certificate Renewal
In the Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to **Domain management**
2. Find `yoraa.in.net` in the domain list
3. Click **Options** → **Force SSL certificate renewal**
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for the certificate to be issued

### 4. Enable HTTPS Redirect
Once SSL is working:
1. Go to **Domain management**
2. Find the "HTTPS" section
3. Enable **"Force HTTPS redirect"**

### 5. Set Primary Domain
1. In **Domain management**
2. Set `yoraa.in.net` as the **primary domain**
3. This ensures all traffic redirects to the correct URL

## DNS Configuration (Already Correct)
✅ Your DNS is already configured correctly:
- Domain is using Netlify's nameservers
- A records point to Netlify's load balancers
- SOA record shows proper Netlify configuration

## Expected Timeline
- SSL certificate provisioning: 5-30 minutes
- DNS propagation: Already complete
- Full HTTPS availability: Within 1 hour

## Verification Steps
Once SSL is working, test:
```bash
curl -I https://yoraa.in.net
curl -I http://yoraa.in.net  # Should redirect to HTTPS
```

## Manual Trigger (Alternative)
If SSL doesn't provision automatically, you can:
1. Remove the custom domain from Netlify
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Re-add the custom domain
4. This forces Netlify to re-verify and provision SSL

**Your site is successfully deployed and accessible!**  
The only remaining step is SSL certificate provisioning, which is typically automatic.
