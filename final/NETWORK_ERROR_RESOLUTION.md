# Network Error Resolution

## Issue Identified: ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED

### Problems Found and Fixed:

1. **Via Placeholder URLs**: Replaced `https://via.placeholder.com/64x80` with local fallback image `/Tshirt.png` in `ManageReviews.jsx`

2. **Hardcoded localhost:3845 URLs**: Fixed broken asset URLs in modal components:
   - `SaveArrangementModal.jsx`: Replaced with Lucide icons
   - `SaveSuccessModal.jsx`: Replaced with Lucide icons

3. **Image Loading Utility**: Created comprehensive image handling system:
   - `src/utils/imageUtils.js`: Utility functions for image fallbacks
   - `src/components/SafeImage.jsx`: Enhanced image component with automatic fallback

### External Resources Still Present:

- **Unsplash images** in `JoinUsControl.jsx` and `ManageBannersOnRewards.jsx`: These are likely working but could cause issues if blocked
- **Firebase CDN** in service worker: Required for Firebase functionality

### To Test Resolution:

1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the application
4. Check for any failed requests (red entries)
5. Verify no "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" errors remain

### Backend Server Status:

✅ Backend server is running on http://localhost:8080
✅ Frontend server is running on http://localhost:3001

### Recommended Actions:

1. If Unsplash images fail, replace with local images
2. Monitor network tab for any remaining external resource failures
3. Consider adding error boundaries for better error handling
4. Use the new `SafeImage` component for all future image displays
